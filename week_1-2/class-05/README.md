# Assignment for Class
Today will be your second exercise in pair programming. You will be assigned to work with a partner, and the two of you will work on and extend each other's guessing games. You will also be further extending your guessing game by including images and working with colors. Once complete you'll be working to deploy your code to the interwebs!
